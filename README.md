# Soil analyses performed on CREA-IT fields

This is a dataset analysed in the paper

Bascietto, M.; Santangelo, E.; Beni, C. Spatial Variations of Vegetation Index from Remote Sensing Linked to Soil Colloidal Status, **2021**, *accepted for publication by Land*
The dataset includes soil analyses performed on October 2019 in the fields property of the [Research Centre for Engineering and Agro-Food Processing](https://www.crea.gov.it/en/web/ingegneria-e-trasformazioni-agroalimentari) (CREA-IT), part of the Italian [Council for Agricultural Research and Economics](https://www.crea.gov.it/en/home), in Monterotondo (province of Rome).

The analyses were performed on 20 soil sampling points, identified by metric coordinates in WGS 84/UTM zone 33N. The physical and chemical properties include (unit of measure):

* Sand (%)
* Silt (%)
* Clay (%)
* pH
* EC (mS/cm)
* Tot. lime (%)
* Act. lime (%)
* SOM (%)
* Org. C (%)
* Tot. N (%)
* Ass. P (mg/kg)
* Exc. Ca (mg/kg)
* Exc. Mg (mg/kg)
* Exc. K (mg/kg)
* Exc. Na (mg/kg)
* Ass. Fe (mg/kg)
* Ass. Mn (mg/kg)
* Ass. Cu (mg/kg)
* Ass. Zn (mg/kg)
* Sol. B (mg/kg)
* Sol. Co (mg/kg)
* CEC (meq/100 g)
* Mg/K (-)
* Moisture (%)

The dataset is a wide-format table (*i.e.* variables in rows, soil points in columns) and comes in comma separated values format and Open Document Spreadsheet format.
